# NFT Book Club Smart Contract

## Vision

The NFT Book Club project aims to create a decentralized platform where book enthusiasts can mint books as NFTs, track their reading progress, and receive rewards for completing books. By using blockchain technology, this project provides a transparent and engaging environment for readers, encouraging reading and creating a community of book lovers with ownership of their books represented as NFTs.

## Features

- **Mint Books as NFTs**: Users can mint books as non-fungible tokens (NFTs), representing ownership of the book on the blockchain.
- **Mark Books as Completed**: Readers can mark books as completed once they finish reading, which updates the status of the NFT.
- **Reward System**: A reward system can be implemented in future iterations to incentivize users for completing books.

## Contract Address

- **Network**: Aptos Devnet
- **Contract Address**: `0xee35294d025a08a4e3acd1501944a2782927f09917295c17c79d9aacc549fec1`

## How It Works

1. **Mint Book**:

   - Users call the `mint_book` function to create an NFT representing the book.
   - The book is registered with details such as the owner's address and book title, and initially marked as not completed.

2. **Complete Book**:
   - Users can call the `complete_book` function once they have finished reading the book.
   - The contract checks if the book is not already marked as completed and then updates its status.
   - The reward mechanism is assumed to be handled in future iterations.

## Future Scope

- **On-Chain Rewards**: Implement a token-based reward system where users earn tokens for completing books, providing additional incentives to read.
- **Book Ownership Transfer**: Add functionality to transfer book NFTs between users, allowing readers to share or sell books in their collection.
- **Reading Groups**: Introduce a feature where users can form reading groups and track their collective progress on books.
- **Discussion and Reviews**: Create a review and discussion section for each book NFT, allowing users to engage in book discussions and share insights.
- **Book Recommendations**: Add a recommendation engine to suggest books based on users' reading history and preferences.
- **Exclusive Content for Owners**: Provide exclusive content or perks for users who own specific book NFTs, such as author Q&A sessions or bonus chapters.

## Getting Started
